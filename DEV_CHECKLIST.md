# 📋 10-Day Development Checklist

## ✅ Day 0-1: Foundation (DONE)
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Core scripts written
- [x] Gravity flip mechanic implemented
- [x] Death detection working
- [x] Basic UI (timer + death overlay)
- [x] ReplayBuffer system foundation
- [x] Kill-switch checkpoints documented

## 🎯 Day 2-3: Core Gameplay Loop

### Must Have:
- [ ] Fix obstacle spawning (verify obstacles appear)
- [ ] Tune gravity flip feel (weight, responsiveness)
- [ ] Adjust runner speed (readable at speed?)
- [ ] Polish death moment (freeze frame, camera shake?)
- [ ] Test on actual device (export to Android/Web)

### Day 3 Kill Check:
- [ ] Does gravity flip feel good?
- [ ] Is runner readable at speed?
- [ ] Is death moment satisfying?

**If NO → STOP HERE**

---

## 🎬 Day 4-7: Replay System

### Must Have:
- [ ] Implement replay playback (read from ReplayBuffer)
- [ ] Add slow-mo effect during replay
- [ ] Camera zoom/shake on death
- [ ] Death text system (random funny messages)
- [ ] Transition: Death → Replay → Share screen

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Particle effects on gravity flip
- [ ] Screen shake on collision
- [ ] Sound effects (flip, death, background music)

### Day 7 Kill Check:
- [ ] Does replay look funny?
- [ ] Does slow-mo work?
- [ ] Does death text land emotionally?

**If NO → STOP HERE**

---

## 📤 Day 8-10: Share & Polish

### Must Have:
- [ ] Share screen with "Restart" and "Share" buttons
- [ ] Export replay to video (native share)
- [ ] Watermark/branding on shared clips
- [ ] Test full loop: Play → Die → Replay → Share

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Death text variants (10+ messages)
- [ ] Subscriber-only death text styles
- [ ] Visual polish (better sprites, backgrounds)
- [ ] Juice (screen shake, particles, tweens)

### Day 10 Kill Check:
- [ ] Do YOU want to share your own fail?
- [ ] Does clip explain game in 2 seconds?

**If NO → STOP. Don't publish.**

---

## 🚀 Post-Day 10: Launch (Only if Day 10 passes)

### Pre-Launch:
- [ ] Create itch.io page
- [ ] Export WebGL build
- [ ] Upload to itch.io
- [ ] Share with 5 friends for feedback

### Android Launch:
- [ ] Set up Google Play Developer account ($25)
- [ ] Create app listing (screenshots, description)
- [ ] Export signed APK
- [ ] Upload to Google Play (internal testing first)

### Marketing:
- [ ] Post clip to Twitter/X
- [ ] Post clip to TikTok
- [ ] Post to r/gamedev, r/indiegames
- [ ] Track: Do people share their clips?

## 🔪 Kill Switches (MANDATORY)

**Day 3:** If gravity flip doesn't feel good → STOP  
**Day 7:** If replay isn't funny → STOP  
**Day 10:** If you wouldn't share your own clip → STOP  

**No exceptions. This is a learning experiment, not a commitment.**

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Week 1:**
- Can you play for 30+ seconds without frustration?
- Do 3/5 friends laugh at the replay?

**Week 2:**
- Do people share their clips organically?
- Does the clip get views/engagement?

**Month 1:**
- 100+ downloads?
- 10+ organic shares?

**If none of these hit → move on. You learned something.**

---

## 🛠️ Technical Debt (Fix Later)

- [ ] Proper sprite art (currently using colored rectangles)
- [ ] Background parallax scrolling
- [ ] Obstacle variety (different shapes/sizes)
- [ ] Difficulty curve (speed ramp every 7s)
- [ ] Leaderboard (if game shows traction)
- [ ] Ads integration (interstitial after 2-3 deaths)
- [ ] Subscription system (cosmetic FX only)

**Don't touch these until Day 10 passes.**

## 💡 Remember

> "You are not building a mobile game. You are building a failure replay engine with a game attached."

If the replay isn't hilarious, nothing else matters.
